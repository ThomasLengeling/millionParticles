glsl driven particle system, made with cinder


this project is inspired by the awesome work of Robert Hodgin and other people who did 
(and do) a lot of cool stuff with code. 

the particle system itself is driven by a ping pong fbo and some perlin noise for particle
movement. 
you will need a copy of cinder to run the code (get it at libcinder.org)


feel free to do whatever you want with it :-)
